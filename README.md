# 1 year journey of studying backend

## what is this repo?

This repository encapsulates a rigorous one-year learning journey, aimed at empowering me to evolve into an enhanced version of myself as a backend engineer.

## why this repo?

I recognized the gaps in my knowledge as a backend engineer and am committed to bridging them through dedicated effort and continuous learning.

## Topics

1. **Foundational Backend Engineering Concepts**
   - Server architecture: Understand different server architectures, such as monolithic, microservices, and serverless.
   - APIs: Learn about RESTful APIs, GraphQL, API design principles, and versioning.
   - HTTP protocols: Deep dive into HTTP methods, status codes, headers, and request/response structures.
   - Networking: Gain knowledge of TCP/IP, DNS, load balancing, and caching mechanisms.
   - Security: Study authentication (JWT, OAuth), authorization, encryption, and best practices for securing APIs.

2. **JavaScript and Web Technologies**
   - ECMAScript Features: Stay up-to-date with the latest JavaScript language features and improvements.
   - Front-end Technologies: Explore HTML5, CSS3, responsive design, and popular front-end frameworks like React or Angular.
   - DOM Manipulation: Understand how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) and manipulate web page elements dynamically.
   - AJAX and Fetch API: Learn how to make asynchronous requests to APIs and handle responses.
   - WebSockets: Explore real-time communication between clients and servers using WebSockets.

3. **Advanced Node.js and Express**
   - Asynchronous Programming: Master the use of callbacks, Promises, async/await, and the Event Loop in Node.js.
   - Streams and Buffers: Understand the concepts of streaming data and handling large files efficiently.
   - Middleware: Learn to write custom middleware for request handling, error handling, logging, etc.
   - Testing and Debugging: Familiarize yourself with unit testing frameworks (e.g., Mocha, Jest), debugging techniques, and performance optimization.
   - Scalability and Caching: Explore techniques for scaling Node.js applications, load balancing, and caching mechanisms.

4. **Database Management**
   - Relational Databases: Deep dive into SQL, normalization, indexing, transactions, and query optimization in databases like PostgreSQL.
   - NoSQL Databases: Understand document-based databases like MongoDB, key-value stores, and their use cases.
   - Data Modeling: Learn to design efficient database schemas, relationships, and handle database migrations.
   - Query Optimization: Study techniques for optimizing database queries, indexing strategies, and denormalization when necessary.
   - Replication and Sharding: Explore concepts of database replication, sharding, and high availability for scaling databases.

5. **Algorithms and Data Structures**
   - Array Manipulation: Master array operations like sorting, searching, merging, and manipulating data.
   - Linked Lists: Understand the implementation of linked lists, operations, and their usage in different scenarios.
   - Stacks and Queues: Learn about stack and queue data structures and their applications.
   - Trees and Graphs: Study tree traversal algorithms, binary search trees, balanced trees, and graph traversal algorithms.
   - Sorting and Searching: Explore different sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort) and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).

6. **Clean Code and Software Engineering Practices**
   - Code Organization and Modularity: Learn how to structure code, separate concerns, and create modular and maintainable applications.
   - Code Smells and Refactoring: Identify common code smells and apply refactoring techniques to improve code quality.
   - Unit Testing: Master unit testing frameworks and write effective test cases to ensure code reliability.
   - Design Patterns: Study various design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer) and understand their applications in solving common software design problems.
   - Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Gain knowledge of CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and deployment strategies.
